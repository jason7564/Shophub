## Description

This is a shopping list mobile app that lets you create a shopping list.

## Instructions

Simply type an item name into the input field which is located in the footer and then click the add button to add the item specified as a list item to your shopping list. All list items are easily deleted and you can even use the checkbox to check off which items you have already picked up.

### Code Details

The code works by getting the value from your input field and appending it to your grocery list. It also saves all entries and even the checkbox status of your entries into your local storage so you don't have to worry about closing the app!
